# The Machine is talking

Books like Martin Fords "Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future" point up that the role of labour will dramatically change in the near future.

All jobs that can be automated by machines, will be automated eventually. By optimizing labor costs, efficiency and accuracy, emerging technologies lead us to the next industrial revolution. However, blue-collar workers still have to compete against machines until industries are fully everted.

Therefore more and more workflows are becoming at least semi-automated by augmenting manpower with technology. A famous example are modern logistic centers, where workers don't need to think for themselves anymore. In order to collect items, their "picking" routes within warehouses are calculated by the server they are connected to. This minimizes error rates and mainly makes use of the labors physical capability, not their intellectual.

## Digital slave

My critical concept goes a step further and envisions a scenario of digitally augmented worker. The computer not just tells them what to do, it even reinterprets their natural body language. As the workers behave like humans, the connected computer outputs artificial voice on their behalf. This both "helps" workers to forget about themselves and deprives their right of decision. I created this prototype to figure out how subjects feel, when they are used as a machine.

I created zipper ribbons that can be bind on the workers arms, hips and buttocks. The ribbons are adjustable to any body shapes and can easily be buckled on other people. I sticked copper plates on the ribbons and soldered circuits using five meters of bell wire. As the user connects these copper contacts, a circuit will be closed. On the other end all wires are soldered onto a hacked keyboard driver chip, which sends keystrokes via USB. The software "Keyboard Maestro" on my computer detects inputs from this particular Human Interface Device (HID) and runs macro scripts based on these inputs. In this way I could roughly map the ribbons to a text-to-speech voice output:

## Voice outputs

To test how subject feel if a computer takes over their voice, I designed two scenarios of typical human-like action during work:

### "I'm happy to serve you"

As the subject of my prototype stops using their hands to work on some object or assembly line, a natural gesture would be to let fall the hands next to the hip. As the subject does this, the contact on the ribbon of his right arm gets connected to the one on his hip. This triggers the voice output "I'm happy to serve you" to remind the worker to keep working.

### "I'm not tired yet"

A contact which is sticked on a chair triggers "I'm not tired yet" as the subject sits down. For this purpose a third ribbon is bind on the upper leg with a contact on the back side. This voice output is supposed to extend workers endurance by self-manipulation.  

## User test




- Quote Ford
- humans lack
- compete against machines
- what if Behave like a machine
- humans not allowed to talk anymore
- computer help the humans to talk
- incapacitation

- augment body parts
- zipper ribbons
- copper surfaces
- connected / soldered using 5 meter of bell wire
- paradoxlely fits every person, regardless of body shapes
-

"I'm happy to serve you" - Standby
"I'm not tired yet" - No break

Prospect:
- Wired worker could be controlling other machines based on movement
- time tracking based on movement. only get paid as you move.
