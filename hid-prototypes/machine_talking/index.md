Books like Martin Fords "Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future" point up that the role of human labour will dramatically change in the nearer future.

All jobs that can be automated by machines, will be automated eventually. By optimizing labor costs, efficiency and accuracy, emerging technologies lead us to the next industrial revolution . However, humans will still have to compete against machines until industries are fully everted.

Therefore more and more workflows becoming at least semi-automated and human labor gets augmented by technology. For instance in modern logistic centers, workers don't need to "think" anymore, because picking routes to collect items from the storage are calculated by the server they are connected to. This minimizes errors and mainly makes use of the labors physical capability, not their intellectual.

## Digital slave

My critical concept envisions a scenario of workers, who are digitally augmented. The computer not only tells them what to do, it even reinterprets their natural human body language. As the subject behaves like human, the connected computer outputs artificial voice on their behalf. This both "helps" the workers to keep working like a machine and deprives their right of decision.

My prototype digitally augments body parts. I created zipper ribbons that can be bind on the workers arms, hip and buttocks. The ribbons are adjustable to any body shapes and can easily be buckled on other people.

On the ribbons I sticked copper plates and soldered a circuit out of five meters bell wire. As the users connects these contacts, the circuit will be closed. The wires are soldered onto a hacked keyboard driver chip, which sends keystrokes to my computer. The software "Keyboard Maestro" which is running on my computer detects inputs from this particular Human Interface Device (HID) and runs macro scripts. In this way I could roughly map movement to a text-to-speech output:

## I'm happy to serve you


## I'm not tired yet



- Quote Ford
- humans lack
- compete against machines
- what if Behave like a machine
- humans not allowed to talk anymore
- computer help the humans to talk
- incapacitation

- augment body parts
- zipper ribbons
- copper surfaces
- connected / soldered using 5 meter of bell wire
- paradoxlely fits every person, regardless of body shapes
-

"I'm happy to serve you" - Standby
"I'm not tired yet" - No break

Prospect:
- Wired worker could be controlling other machines based on movement
- time tracking based on movement. only get paid as you move.
