WORK IN PROGESSS

Books like Martin Fords "Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future" comprehensively argue that the role of human labour will dramatically change in the future. All jobs that can be automated by machines, will be automated eventually. Emerging technologies leads us to the next industrial revolution. But until the industries are entirely everted, human labor will still have to compete against machines in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The problem: Humans tend to chat, rest, wait, eat or even sleep.

## What if humans could act like machines?

My critical concept envisions a working scenario, that is fully supported by a computer. While humans are not supposed to talk anymore during their work and based on their body language and movement the computer is outputting voice on their behalf. This both deprives the workers right of decision and standardizes working routines. Therefore the computer "helps" the computer to talk.

My prototype is a digital augmentation of body parts. I created zipper ribbons that can be bind on the workers arms, hip and buttocks. The ribbons are adjustable to any body shapes and can easily be buckled on other people.

On the ribbons I sticked copper plates contacts and soldered a circuit out of five meters bell wire. As the users connects these contacts, the circuit will be closed. The wires are soldered onto a hacked keyboard driver chip, which sends keystrokes to my computer. The software "Keyboard Maestro" which is running on my computer detects inputs from this particular Human Interface Device (HID) and runs macro scripts. In this way I could roughly map movement to a text-to-speech output:

## I'm happy to serve you


## I'm not tired yet



- Quote Ford
- humans lack
- compete against machines
- what if Behave like a machine
- humans not allowed to talk anymore
- computer help the humans to talk
- incapacitation

- augment body parts
- zipper ribbons
- copper surfaces
- connected / soldered using 5 meter of bell wire
- paradoxlely fits every person, regardless of body shapes
-

"I'm happy to serve you" - Standby
"I'm not tired yet" - No break

Prospect:
- Wired worker could be controlling other machines based on movement
- time tracking based on movement. only get paid as you move.
